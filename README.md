# Micro-Finance-Startup

Our micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities to low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. We want to slowly move our code to Git. I will be hosting the sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey. I will also introduce a course and create supporting documents for the open source project including code of conduct, and contributing guidelines. Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.
